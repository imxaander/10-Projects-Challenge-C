# IMXSHELL
my own unix / linux shell

## Features
it supports the following: 
`ls` `cd` `pwd` `clear` and external applications in my system inside /bin/ directory so basically, it can run majority of the commands available to your native linux terminal.

## Application / Learning
This time i learned about the following:
 - `exec()` family, `fork()` and unix idea of process and programs (*child, parent processess, etc.*)
 - `readdir, opendir, dirents` 
 - **Designated Initializers** (i used in the command lookup table)
 - **Function Pointers** 
 - More practice on `realloc, malloc`
